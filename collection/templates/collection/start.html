    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>In this experiment you will be shown some visualisations that display data about businesses and people associated with those businesses.</p>

    <p>You will be asked several questions that require you to locate information within the visualisation. The questions will be similar to "Where does Joe Smith live?" and "Who are the directors of ANU?".</p>

    <p>There is a time restriction on answering the questions of <strong>45 seconds</strong>. There will be a timer at the top of the page to show you how much time you have left. If you complete a question before the 45 seconds is up, press the <strong>Next</strong> button to move to the next question. If you do not complete the question in the allotted time the page will automatically move you to the next question and you will not be able to reattempt the question.</p>

    <p>You will be scored on the number of questions you answer correctly. If you do no answer a question it will be marked as incorrect. Therefore, the goal is to answer as many questions as possible.</p>

    <p>There are 12 questions so the experiment will take less than 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>When you are ready to begin please press the <strong>Begin</strong> button.</p>
