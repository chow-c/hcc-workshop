                <p>Cyber security is not just about preventing unauthorised access, but it is also about preventing misuse of information that we willingly provide. We are living in a digital age, with so many people carrying out their lives in an online environment. This means that personal information about each and everyone one of us is constantly being transmitted across the Internet and stored on servers in various places around the globe in the cloud. Have a think about how you use the Internet. What social media websites do you use? How many devices do you access these sites on? With every post you share, status you like, video you upload and selfie you snap, you are creating a digital trail that tells a story. It is important that all of this data is protected appropriately. </p><p><em><span style="font-size:0.9em;text-align:center">On the diagram below, select which social media websites you use to visualise the data you are uploading to the Internet.</span></em></p>

        <p>A recent report by Cisco estimates that global Internet traffic will exceed the zettabyte (that's one <em>trillion</em> gigabytes). Figures suggest that with every minute that passes by, over 300 hours of footage is uploaded to Youtube alone. That means that in the time you have been on this page, users around the world have uploaded over <span id="hours"></span> hours of video!</p>
        <p>With so much data available, it is important to consider where your information is going, who has access to it, and what they are doing with it. An important aspect of cyber security is therefore ensuring personal privacy.</p>

        <h1>How does this relate to Human Centred Computing?</h1>
        <p>People are the most important aspect of ICT. Technology is great for assisting us with our every day lives, from making tasks easier to making life more enjoyable. However, humans are often considered to be the weakest link in the cyber security of a system. For example, if a human user has direct access to data, by manipulating the user (with or without their knowledge or intent), a malicious adversary can cause damage whilst bypassing a large range of technical controls. Additionally, we want to make sure our interaction with technology is a safe one, and is not used as a means to do us harm through misuse of our personal information.</p>
        <p>Cyber security is an active area of research in the ANU Human Centred Computing research group. By understanding how humans interact with technology, it assists us in implementing better security. We also look at ways of adding additional security measures into systems to preserve your privacy. This might involve developing special transformations to the data so that it is unrecognisable, or by utilising your subconscious thoughts and actions to serve as a means of representing you in an 'un-hackable' way. </p>
        <p>The knowledge learnt from studying human-centred computing can contribute toward improving cyber security education, user policies, as well as the implementation of technical controls that protect users against manipulation.</p>
