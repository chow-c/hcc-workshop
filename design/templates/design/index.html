		<p class="text-justify">Welcome to an introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI). You may be wondering, what is HCI? HCI is about the design, evaluation, and implementation of of computer systems that facilitates effective human use. HCI puts the human before anything else. </p>
		<p class="text-justify">But there are A LOT of poorly designed websites and software out there, I'm sure you have encountered many! Our goal is to introduce you to some design principles that can make interfaces better for interaction, and to hopefully interest you enough to come help us fight the battle against bad interface design!</p>
		<p class="text-justify">In this activity you will get to play some little activities that teach you some of the design principles that are fundamental in HCI. The more you play, the higher your skill level will become. See how skilled you can get and if you can beat your friends! </p>
