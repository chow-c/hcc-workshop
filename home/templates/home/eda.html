		<p class="text-justify">The Human Centred Computing (HCC) research group at ANU collects a wide range of psychophysiological data from participants as they carry out various tasks similar to those which you have been doing today. One of the main sources of signal that is used in our research is electrodermal activity (EDA), which is the change in electrical conductivity of the skin.</p>
		Also referred to as galvanic skin response (GSR) or skin conductance, the changes in the level of sweat is controlled by your sympathetic nervous system. Neural activity affects sweat gland permeability, which can be observed as changes in the resistance of the skin to a small electrical current, or as differences in the electrical potential between different parts of the skin. Computational models can detect these changes, and use the data to infer a change in arousal or mental activity. We use these inferences to make judgements about the difficulty, excitement and enjoyment of computer-based tasks.</p>
		<p>Alert! What are psychophysiological signals? <br>These are your physiological and physical responses to psychological and cognitive processes. Put simply we measure heart rate, brain waves, eye movements, skin temperature, pupil dilation, accelerometer data, and much more. We analyse this data to make inferences about the psychological and cognitive processes that are occuring, such as reading comprehension, visual inspection of images, or whether you think an email is spam or not. </p>

			<div class="col-md-8">
				<p class="text-justify">Measuring psychophysiological signals requires a number of specialist devices. To collect GSR data, the Human Centred Computing research group uses an Empatica E4. Built by a startup out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA, the Empatica E4 is a portable wristband that collects research-grade data, including EDA. </p>
				<p>We have a number of Empatica E4 devices available for you to try on and use. The E4s pair with an iOS device to allow researchers to visualise and stream data in real time. Please approach the Empatica E4 station to try on one of these devices.</p>
				<p>Use an iOS device? Tired of waiting? Install the free Empatica application, approach an instructor and try it out on your own iOS device!</p>
