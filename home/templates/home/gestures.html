		<h2>What we do</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">The Human Centred Computing group researches different ways to humans can interact with interfaces. We want interaction to go beyond the classic mouse and keyboard! Imagine interacting with the your computer directly with your hands like in Minority Report.</p>

		<p class="text-justify">There are a lot of different way to implement gestural based interaction, such as with the Micrsoft Kinect or Leap Motion. Another is using a new device called Myo. </p>
		<p class="text-justify">The Myo is an armband that you wear on your forearm. It uses  electromyographic (EMG) sensors to detect the electrical activity from the forearm muscles. It also uses a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer to recognise gestures from the hand the device is connected to.  A gyroscope is used to measure rotational movement. They are used in combination with accelerometers to detect the movement of the device in 3D space. An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration of a moving body. These devices are very common, such as in your smart phone or Fitbit! If you have a Fitbit, that's how it counts your steps! Accelerometers usually measure the 3 axes of movement, left-right, up-down, and vertical. A magnetometer is a device that measures magnetism and can be used as a compass. By combining all of this data together, the Myo armband can be used to control interfaces such as video games and Powerpoint presentations.</p>
		<h2>Why we do it</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">Creating hands free interactions gives users alternate, more flexible, and ergonomic ways of interacting with interfaces. In the medical domain, hands free interaction opens up the possibility of surgeons interacting with a computer to view medical scans of a patient during surgery.</p>

			<h3>What is electromyography?</h3>
			<p class="text-justify">Electromyography (EMG) is the recording the electrical activity produced by muscles. An electromyograph is the device used to collect EMG. It detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when they are activated. It is often used for medical diagnostic purposes, such as for identifying neuromuscular diseases. <br>In this activity we won't be using it for medical reasons, but instead to demonstrate that there are a lot of ways to interact with interfaces.</p>
