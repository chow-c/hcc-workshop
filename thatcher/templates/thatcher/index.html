      <p class="text-justify">The Thatcher Effect, or Thatcher illusion, illustrates that the brain has special processes for face recognition, which do not apply when viewing upside down photo of a face. This has been illustrated by making local changes to the face, typically the eyes and mouth. Whilst the changes are blatantly obvious when the photo of the face is the right way up, and holistic face processing occurs, these changes are far more difficult to detect when the image is turned upside down.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">The effect is named after Margaret Thatcher, a former British Prime Minister, because her photo that was used to famously illustrate the illusion.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Letâ€™s test it out on some images of faces you may be familiar with to see if you can see the effect.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Select the eyes (separately) and the mouth with your mouse cursor. Once selected press the rotate button and see the effect for yourself. Hit the rotate button again to see the image the right way up. If you create an image that you wish to keep, click 'save' to insert it into your website. Saving another image will replace the previous image.</p>
